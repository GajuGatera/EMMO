The team divided itself into 3 different teams to create a wind turbine miniature model. This is an important stage of design because models are meant to help understand how the actual product will work. Thus, 2 out of the 3 team managed to light up the LED. At the end of the day, we all gathered to discuss common problems with the prototypes and things to look out once we actually build the wind turbine.
