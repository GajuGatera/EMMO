The first major product that the team built was the human power generator. The table generator gives hands on experience and knowledget needed to start building more complex devices. Aside from that it is a way of investing in a system that will provide electricity without any costs and at anytime (capital cost not included of course). The bycicle generator is better suited for people that live in villages or off-grid as a back up system when there is electricity outage.
