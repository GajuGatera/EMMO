After creating the models for the wind turbine, we moved onto hydroelectric generator. Instead of separating into teams, we put all our forces together to accomplish one product. It was not after days of hard work that we managed to light up the LED to everyoneâ€™s excitement. Sylvie is currently a third year studying Mechanical and Energy Engineering. She explains the building process as well as how the team managed to get everything working.
