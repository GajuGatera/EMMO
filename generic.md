This project stemed from the fact that in Rwanda, electricity is still very sparsed. It is our mission to increase the amount of electricity in Rwanda by using renewable energy. With a team of 20 young, motivated students who range from expertise in electrical, mechanical and software engineering, we are working to see our mission come to completion. 

As of summer 2018, this project is at its research stage. We are experimenting different devices and dedicating these 10 weeks to allow failure. However, it is our hope that this research will be successful enough to become something much bigger.
